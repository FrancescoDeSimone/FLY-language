FLY conditional control structures are standard and follows the same statements of languages like Java. About iterative controls, FLY provides the for and while loop statements. Two kinds of for loops can be used in FLY, the former uses the Range definition, and enables the program to loop in a range
of integer values. The latter, enables the program to iterate over a FLY object or a file. Fully details about iteration over a file are available in the language documentation.
